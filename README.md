# DSA456 Learning and Assignments
This repository contains a collection of all the source code and files that I used in order to learn Data Structures and Algorithms in Python and complete all the assignments in this course. It also contains the solution to the assignments and projects completed as a part of this course.</br>
You can find the course notes here: [DSA456 Notes](https://seneca-ictoer.github.io/data-structures-and-algorithms/)

## Introduction
### Data Structures

Data structures are used to store and retrieve data efficiently. They provide a way to organize and manage information in a digital space. Common data structures in programming languages include lists, arrays, dictionaries, and objects.

#### Inputting Information

Inputting information involves determining how data is received and added to the structure. It considers the type of information, position for insertion (beginning, end, middle), and updates to existing data.

#### Processing Information

Processing information involves manipulating data within the data structure. It can occur concurrently or as a result of other processes. Existing data may need to be adapted to accommodate new, updated, or removed data.

#### Maintaining Information

Maintaining information focuses on organizing data within the structure and managing relationships between data elements. It also includes allocating memory to accommodate the data.

#### Retrieving Information

Retrieving information involves finding and returning stored data. It defines the steps taken by the data structure to access the information.

#### Choosing the Right Data Structure

Choosing the right data structure depends on the intended purpose of the data. It's important to assess the built-in functionality of data structures for specific tasks, evaluate requirements for memory control and allocation, and compare the runtime performance of different data structures.

### Algorithms

Algorithms are sets of instructions that guide the computer in performing tasks. They utilize data stored in data structures to process and manipulate the data.

#### Using Algorithms

Algorithms are employed to carry out tasks on data. They enable data manipulation and processing. Examples include sorting a list of numbers or performing mathematical operations on data.

These notes provide an overview of data structures and algorithms, their functions, and their importance in software development. Feel free to expand on each section or add more details as needed.

# Disclaimer
Please don't just copy the code mindlessly without trying to solve the problems yourself, it's totally pointless if you actually wanna learn how to write software and a blatant violation of the [Academic Integrity](https://www.senecacollege.ca/about/policies/academic-integrity-policy.html) policy of the course.
