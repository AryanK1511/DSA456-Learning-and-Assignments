# DSA456 Learning and Assignments
This repository contains a collection of all the source code and files that I used in order to learn Data Structures and Algorithms in Python and complete all the assignments in this course. It also contains the solution to the assignments and projects completed as a part of this course.</br>
You can find the course notes here: [DSA456 Notes](https://seneca-ictoer.github.io/data-structures-and-algorithms/)

# Disclaimer
Please don't just copy the code mindlessly without trying to solve the problems yourself, it's totally pointless if you actually wanna learn how to write software and a blatant violation of the [Academic Integrity](https://www.senecacollege.ca/about/policies/academic-integrity-policy.html) policy of the course.
