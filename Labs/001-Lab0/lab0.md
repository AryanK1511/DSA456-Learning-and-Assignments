## LaTex Formulas

Put your formulas here

- hypotenus of a right angle triangle: $$c = \sqrt(a^2 + b^2)$$
- geometric series: $$\sum_{i=\cancel{0}}^{n} ar^i$$
- arithmetic series closed form: $$\sum_{i=1}^{n} (i) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4...n={(n)(n+1) \over 2}$$

## Reflection here

1. I forgot how to create charts so that was the most challenging part.

2. I liked the idea of coding and testing your program on GitHub itself without having to clone the repo and pushing the changes back. Overall, code spaces is a really good idea if we are editing small code snippets.
