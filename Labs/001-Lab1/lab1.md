# Reflection for Lab 1
I have programmed in python before, but it has been quite a while since I used it. It was good to be back and to be able to work with the language that I started programming with.

- What did you like/not like about Python?
I'd say that python is a very easy language to use as it is not strongly typed and you don’t have to manually do a lot of processes like you had to do in C++. The only tricky part with python is getting the indentation right as this language depends hugely on indenting the code right to form code blocks.

- Was there anything that behaved differently than you expected in Python?
The idea of classes and objects works differently in python when compared to C++. This is because there is a lot more complexity that comes with python. For instance, the constructor must be a function called "__init__". Also, every one of the member functions are required to have the "self" parameter.

- Based on what you wrote in your lab, write something about the similarities and differences between Python with C/C++ and how that affects how you write your program.
Overall, I think that python is very handy and easy to use compared to C++ but it does not give you enough control over the system’s resources as memory management and pointers are abstracted from us.
1. Python is a dynamically typed language whereas C++ is statically typed.
2. Python is an interpreted language whereas C++ is compiled.
3. C++ has more control over memory management.
4. Python has a lot less syntax and uses common and easy to use English which makes it more user friendly.
5. C++ does not care about how you indent the code, whereas it is an imperative part of writing code in python.
6. Features like arrays and variables are a lot more flexible in python compared to C++
